###
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the machine-learning pipeline that involves analyzing and visualizing data 
to gain insights and inform subsequent modeling decisions. EDA helps in understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships 
within the dataset. 

###
Data Visualization:
Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.) to explore the distribution of individual features and relationships 
between variables.

###
Seaborn Library 
Seaborn is a popular Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for 
drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is particularly well-suited for visualizing complex datasets 
with multiple variables.

###
Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a comprehensive 2D plotting library for Python that produces static, animated, and interactive visualizations in a variety of 
formats. It is one of the most widely used and versatile plotting libraries in the Python ecosystem.

### 
Histogram 
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It consists of bars, 
where the length of each bar represents the frequency or count of data values falling into a particular range or bin.

### 
Boxplot
A boxplot (box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It displays the summary statistics 
of the dataset, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, using a box and whisker format.

###
Scatterplot
A scatterplot is a two-dimensional plot that displays individual data points as dots. 
It is used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Each dot represents an observation in the dataset.

### 
Pairplot
A pairplot is a matrix of scatterplots where each variable in the dataset is paired with every other variable. 
It is particularly useful for visualizing relationships between multiple variables in a dataset.

###
Heatmap
A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values in a matrix are represented as colors. It is often used to visualize the 
correlation between variables in a dataset. Darker colors usually indicate higher values, while lighter colors indicate lower values.

###
Lineplot
A lineplot is a type of plot where data points are connected by straight lines. 
It is commonly used to visualize the trend of a variable over a continuous interval, such as time.

###
Violinplot
A violin plot is a combination of a boxplot and a kernel density plot. It displays the distribution of a dataset, showing the 
probability density of different values. The width of the plot at a particular value represents the density of observations at that value.
