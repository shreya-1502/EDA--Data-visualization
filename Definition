###
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights and inform subsequent modeling decisions.
EDA helps in understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. 

###
Data Visualization:
Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.) to explore the distribution of individual features and relationships between variables.
